Assignment 07

Write a Script that demonstrates Pickling and Exception Handling.
Introduction:
The purpose of this assignment is to create a new script that demonstrates the techniques of pickling and exception handling in a python.  Pickling is the process where a data from a file is converted and stored in a binary way which obscures the data and condenses it.  Exception handling is the process when writing scripts where one identifies errors and can custom code a message (or rather error message) so it is easier for another user or collaborator to understand where the program may be faltering.  To do this I created a script that stored some data for a gradebook and then later loaded the data.  Additionally, we were asked to post this in a GitHub page.
